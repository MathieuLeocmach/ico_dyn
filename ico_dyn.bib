  abstract = {Understanding glass formation is a challenge, because the existence
	of a true glass state, distinct from liquid and solid, remains elusive:
	Glasses are liquids that have become too viscous to flow. An old
	idea, as yet unproven experimentally, is that the dynamics becomes
	sluggish as the glass transition approaches, because increasingly
	larger regions of the material have to move simultaneously to allow
	flow. We introduce new multipoint dynamical susceptibilities to estimate
	quantitatively the size of these regions and provide direct experimental
	evidence that the glass formation of molecular liquids and colloidal
	suspensions is accompanied by growing dynamic correlation length
	scales.},

	liquids remains a fundamental open question in condensed-matter science.
	For more than 40 years it has been conjectured that liquids with
	centrosymmetric interactions may be composed of icosahedral building
	blocks. But these proposed mobile, randomly orientated structures
	have remained experimentally inaccessible owing to the unavoidable
	averaging involved in scattering experiments, which can therefore
	determine only the isotropic radial distribution function. Here we
	overcome this limitation by capturing liquid fragments at a solid-liquid
	interface, and observing the scattering of totally internally reflected
	(evanescent) X-rays, which are sensitive only to the liquid structure
	at the interface. Using this method, we observe five-fold local symmetry
	in liquid lead adjacent to a silicon wall, and obtain an experimental
	portrait of the icosahedral fragments that are predicted to occur
	in all close-packed monatomic liquids. By shedding new light on local
	bond order in disordered structures such as liquids and glasses,
	these results should lead to a better microscopic understanding of
	melting, freezing and supercooling.},

	that the colloid volume fraction changes significantly on the length
	scale of the particle size. The extended sedimentation profiles of
	the colloids with long-ranged repulsions are well-described by theory.
	Surprisingly, the theory even seems to hold at concentrations where

	slows down, but also becomes progressively more heterogeneous. From
	our simulations and experiments of six different glass-forming liquids,
	we find that the heterogeneous dynamics is a result of critical-like
	fluctuations of static structural order, contrary to a common belief
	that it is purely of dynamic origin. The static correlation length
	and susceptibility of a structural order parameter show Ising-like
	power-law divergence towards the ideal glass-transition point. However,
	this structural ordering accompanies little density change, which
	explains why it has not been detected by the static structure factor
	so far. Our results suggest a far more direct link than thought before
	between glass transition and critical phenomena. Indeed, the glass
	transition may be a new type of critical phenomenon where a structural
	order parameter is directly linked to slowness.},
