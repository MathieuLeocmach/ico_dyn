@article{tanaka2010critical,
abstract = {Recently it has been revealed that when approaching the glass-transition temperature, T(g), the dynamics of a liquid not only drastically slows down, but also becomes progressively more heterogeneous. From our simulations and experiments of six different glass-forming liquids, we find that the heterogeneous dynamics is a result of critical-like fluctuations of static structural order, contrary to a common belief that it is purely of dynamic origin. The static correlation length and susceptibility of a structural order parameter show Ising-like power-law divergence towards the ideal glass-transition point. However, this structural ordering accompanies little density change, which explains why it has not been detected by the static structure factor so far. Our results suggest a far more direct link than thought before between glass transition and critical phenomena. Indeed, the glass transition may be a new type of critical phenomenon where a structural order parameter is directly linked to slowness.},

abstract = {The existence of systematic variations of isobaric fragility in different supercooled Lennard-Jones binary mixtures is revealed by molecular dynamics simulations. The connection between fragility and local structures in the bulk is analyzed by means of a Voronoi construction. It is found that clusters of particles belonging to locally preferred structures form slow, long-lived domains, whose spatial extension increases with decreasing temperature. As a general rule, a more rapid growth, upon supercooling, of such domains is associated with a more pronounced super-Arrhenius behavior, and hence to a larger fragility.},

abstract = {We have measured equilibrium sedimentation profiles in a colloidal model system with confocal microscopy. By tuning the interactions, we have determined the gravitational length in the limit of hard-sphere-like interactions, and using the same particles, tested a recent theory [R.van Roij, J. Phys. Cond. Mat. 15, S3569, (2003)], which predicts a significantly extended sedimentation profile in the case of charged colloids with long-ranged repulsions, due to a spontaneously formed macroscopic electric field. For the hard-sphere-like system we find that the gravitational length matches that expected. By tuning the buoyancy of the colloidal particles we have shown that a mean field hydrostatic equilibrium description even appears to hold in the case that the colloid volume fraction changes significantly on the length scale of the particle size. The extended sedimentation profiles of the colloids with long-ranged repulsions are well-described by theory. Surprisingly, the theory even seems to hold at concentrations where interactions between the colloids, which are not modeled explicitly, play a considerable role.},

@article{Reichert2000,
abstract = {The local point symmetry of the short-range order in simple monatomic liquids remains a fundamental open question in condensed-matter science. For more than 40 years it has been conjectured that liquids with centrosymmetric interactions may be composed of icosahedral building blocks. But these proposed mobile, randomly orientated structures have remained experimentally inaccessible owing to the unavoidable averaging involved in scattering experiments, which can therefore determine only the isotropic radial distribution function. Here we overcome this limitation by capturing liquid fragments at a solid-liquid interface, and observing the scattering of totally internally reflected (evanescent) X-rays, which are sensitive only to the liquid structure at the interface. Using this method, we observe five-fold local symmetry in liquid lead adjacent to a silicon wall, and obtain an experimental portrait of the icosahedral fragments that are predicted to occur in all close-packed monatomic liquids. By shedding new light on local bond order in disordered structures such as liquids and glasses, these results should lead to a better microscopic understanding of melting, freezing and supercooling.},

@article{Berthier2005,
abstract = {Understanding glass formation is a challenge, because the existence of a true glass state, distinct from liquid and solid, remains elusive: Glasses are liquids that have become too viscous to flow. An old idea, as yet unproven experimentally, is that the dynamics becomes sluggish as the glass transition approaches, because increasingly larger regions of the material have to move simultaneously to allow flow. We introduce new multipoint dynamical susceptibilities to estimate quantitatively the size of these regions and provide direct experimental evidence that the glass formation of molecular liquids and colloidal suspensions is accompanied by growing dynamic correlation length scales.},

The fluorescent dyes are RITC (rhodamine isothiocyanate)-aminostyrene (RAS) and 4-methylaminoethylmethacrylate-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol (NBD-MAEM), which are prepared from (commercially available) RITC and 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol (NBD-Cl), respectively, as starting materials. The particles can be grown larger with nonfluorescent PMMA. Examples of the usefulness of these model particles in colloid science are given.},

@article{tarjus2005fba,
abstract = {One of the most spectacular phenomena in physics in terms of dynamical range is the glass transition and the associated slowing down of flow and relaxation with decreasing temperature. That it occurs in many different liquids seems to call for a "universal" theory. In this article, we review one such theoretical approach which is based on the concept of "frustration". Frustration in this context describes an incompatibility between extension of the locally preferred order in a liquid and tiling of the whole space. We provide a critical assessment of what has been achieved within this approach and we discuss the relation with other theories of the glass transition.},
